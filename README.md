## How to use my graph visualization

1. To save changes to a file, click on the "Save Changes" button and a downloaded json file named "new_output_graph.json" will appear in your downloads.

3. There is a "switch layout" button to see the linear layout. Click the button againt to go back to original layout.

4. **Case sensitive. You can enter the attribute and press the search key to view all nodes matching that attribute. Clear the search bar and then click search to revert back to original graph.

5. To view a subset, first click on the node so that the edit box on the right shows up. Then, double click on each node you want to add to your subset (they will turn lightblue on click). Then click on the "view subset" button. If you want to go back to viewing the whole graph, click "view subset" again. Note: this is will not reset the subset nodes. You must manually click on the node so that the edit box on the right shows up. Then, double click each light blue node to remove it from the viewing subset and then hit "cancel" in the edit box and the color of the node should go back to its cluster color. you can now proceed to adding nodes to your subset. 

6. To find the De Niro number of each node, hover over the node. To find the path to the nearest De Niro vertex, click on the node. If you want to stop seeing the path, hit the cancel button in the edit box. If you remove a node or create a new edge and then immediately after attempt to view a de niro path for any node, double click on the node to view the path. After that, any other path you view you can double click or single click. Note: if you edit the graph in any way, the de niro number will not update.
